        <h2> 
         I like your eyes, you look away when you pretend not to care. I like the dimples on the corners of the smile that you wear. I like you more, the world may know but don't be scared, because I'm falling deeper, baby be prepared.
            
         I like your shirt, I like your fingers, I love the way that you smell. I want to be your favorite jacket, just so I could always be near. I loved you for so long, sometimes it's hard to bear, But after all this time, I hope you wait and see.
        </h2>

        <h2> I like the way you try so hard when you play ball with your friends, I like the way you hit the notes, in every song you're shining. I love the little things, like when you're unaware. I catch you steal a glance and smile so perfectly. Though sometimes when life brings me down, You're the cure my love. In a bad rainy day. You take all the worries away. </h2>
    <hr>

        <h2>  I love you every minute, every second. I love you everywhere and any moment. Always and forever I know I can't quit you, because baby you're the one, I don't know how. In a world devoid of life, you bring color. In your eyes I see the light, my future. Always and forever with you, now I can't let you go. I'm in love with you, and now you know.
        But then that thought also crosses your mind of “what if.” What if one day you get it right? You think about a future you don’t know exists, but only in your imagination. You hold onto that hope and a history it is all you can do.  </h2>
